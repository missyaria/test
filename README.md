# LISTING.py, a program that lists the content of the directory you're in
![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/missyaria/test)

This is an irrelevant program that justs lists the content of the directory you're in and prints the path. 
The goal is to practice the notion of Open-Source projects.

# Installation

Pyinstaller needs to be installed if it's not already the case.

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
Go to the path where the file is located, then run the following command :

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile LISTING.py
```
